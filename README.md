# Proactive System

This repository features the source code and 3D designs for the *proactive system* developed as part of my thesis project **Shaping proactivity - Designing interactions with proactive ambient artefacts**.

It includes following parts:
-   Backend system to be used on the server side
-   Arduino sketch for the smart coaster
-   Arduino sketch for the tabletop robot
-   STL files to 3D print the coaster enclosure
-   STL files to 3D print the tabletop robot


Note: in order to run the system a credentials.json file for the Google Calendar API has to be provided.
